# CMG Engineering Audition

### 0) Project basics, vision
When I was about to solve the task, I did figure out how I'm able to pass my thoughts. The idea is this README with a bit blog style. I want to go forward section by section.

So I'm planning two separate solution for the task. One **procedural/functional approach** and the **requested OOP approach**.

Outside of the given example I want to generate larger ones, and try to make a better format for logging too; so at the end I'm able to benchmark both of the solutions to decide which is better with different amount of data sets.

Want to go by TDD and comment the code unnecessarily extensively, to pass my thoughts about some parts. I will use Git so you can see the progress of my work; and after the final adjustments I just have to share the repository.
